# ASPP_project

This project serves the purpose of adding proper test functions to my RelayServer class (available at https://github.com/Lexelius/RelayServer). The RelayServer recieves and pre-processes data that is streamed from e.g. detectors before it sends this data upon requests from the main analyzing program.
