# ASPP_project

This project serves the purpose of adding proper test functions to my RelayServer class (available at https://github.com/Lexelius/RelayServer). The RelayServer recieves and pre-processes data that is streamed from e.g. detectors before it sends this data upon requests from the main analyzing program.
If time allows, test functions will also be added to the subclass LiveScan I'm working on (available at https://github.com/Lexelius/ptypy/blob/livescan/ptypy/experiment/livescan.py), which is the receiving end of the analyzing program.
